                                    Kalki (Sanskrit: कल्कि), also called Kalkin,[1] is the prophesied tenth and final
                                    incarnation of the god Vishnu. He is described to appear in order to end the Kali
                                    Yuga, one of the four periods in the endless cycle of existence (Krita) in Vaishnava
                                    cosmology. The end of the Kali Yuga states this will usher in the new epoch of Satya
                                    Yuga in the cycle of existence, until the Mahapralaya (dissolution of the
                                    universe).[1][2]

                                    Kalki is described in the Puranas as the avatar who rejuvenates existence by ending
                                    the darkest and destructive period to remove adharma (unrighteousness) and ushering
                                    in the Satya Yuga, while riding a white horse with a fiery sword.[2] The description
                                    and details of Kalki are different among various Puranas. Kalki is also found in
                                    Buddhist texts, for example the Kalachakra-Tantra of Tibetan Buddhism.[11][12][13]

                                    The prophecy of the Kalki avatara is also told in Sikh texts.[14]

                                Kalki is an avatara of Vishnu. Avatar means "descent", and refers to a descent of
                                the divine into the material realm of human existence. The Garuda Purana lists ten
                                incarnations, with Kalki being the final one.[16] He is described as the incarnation
                                who appears at the end of the Kali Yuga. He ends the darkest, degenerating, and
                                chaotic stage of the Kali Yuga to remove adharma and ushers in the Satya Yuga, while
                                riding a white horse with a fiery sword.[2][17] He restarts a new cycle of time.[18]
                                He is described as a Brahmin warrior in the Puranas.[2][17] It is mentioned in the
                                Puranas that the immortal Chiranjivis will assist him in various stages of his
                                life.[19]
