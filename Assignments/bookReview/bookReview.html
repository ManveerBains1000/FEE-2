                <big><b>Summary: </b></big>The Alchemist (Portuguese: O Alquimista) is a novel by Brazilian author
                Paulo Coelho
                which was first published in 1988. Originally written in Portuguese, it became a widely translated
                international
                bestseller.The story follows the shepherd boy Santiago in his journey across North Africa to the
                Egyptian
                pyramids after he dreams of finding a treasure there.
                An Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago dreams of a treasure while in a ruined church. He consults a
                Gypsy fortune-teller about the meaning of the recurring dream. The woman interprets it as a prophecy,
                telling the boy that he will discover a treasure at the Egyptian pyramids.

                After Santiago sets out, he meets an old king Melchizedek, or the king of Salem, who tells him to sell
                his sheep so as to travel to Egypt and accomplish his "Personal Legend". Early on his arrival in Africa,
                a man who claims to be able to take Santiago to the pyramids instead robs him of the money he had made
                from his flock. Santiago then has to work for a crystal merchant to earn enough to continue his journey.

                <big><b>Summary: </b></big>
                Thinking, Fast and Slow is a 2011 popular science book by psychologist Daniel Kahneman. The book's main
                thesis is a differentiation between two modes of thought: "System 1" is fast, instinctive and emotional;
                "System 2" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.

                The book delineates rational and non-rational motivations or triggers associated with each type of
                thinking process, and how they complement each other, starting with Kahneman's own research on loss
                aversion. From framing choices to people's tendency to replace a difficult question with one which is
                easy to answer, the book summarizes several decades of research to suggest that people have too much
                confidence in human judgment.[1] Kahneman performed his own research, often in collaboration with Amos
                Tversky, which enriched his experience to write the book.[2][3] It covers different phases of his
                career: his early work concerning cognitive biases, his work on prospect theory and happiness, and with
                the Israel Defense Forces.

                The book was a New York Times bestseller[4] and was the 2012 winner of the National Academies
                Communication Award for best creative work that helps the public understanding of topics in behavioral
                science, engineering and medicine.[5] The integrity of some priming studies cited in the book has been
                called into question in the midst of the psychological replication crisis.[6]</p>

                <p><big><b>Summary: </b></big>Building on exchanges he had with readers of his e-mail list, in 2018
                    Clear published his book Atomic Habits on how to build tiny, frequent habits that have a large
                    beneficial and cumulative effect on one's life. According to the intro of his book, he had to build
                    such habits when rehabilitating from a severe cranial injury that he suffered when playing
                    baseball.[6]

                    In his book, he also argues against formulating goals and plans as a large majority of people do not
                    have trouble designing them, but following them in everyday life. This is reminiscent of the
                    implementation intentions that emerged in the research activities of German psychologist Peter
                    Gollwitzer.[7]

                    Several authors have built upon Atomic Habits by publishing workbooks and implementation guides.[8]
                    In February 2024 Clear announced he had created a new habits app called Atoms.[9
